Despite being motivated by his teachers to move to Europe/US for higher studies, he chose to go back to his native place and joined Patna Science College as a lecturer in 1980.

The college holds a special place in his heart since it transformed him from an average student, who used to struggle with marks during his school days, into a topper. While teaching Physics to 11th and 12th standards, he observed that even the brightest students of the class were unable to thoroughly understand the concepts owing to the tough language integrated with a cultural difference of the books authored by foreign writers. Driven by his strong desire to make the subject of Physics interesting and enjoyable to Indian students, he decided to write a simple and easy to understand book incorporated with original numerical examples. Prof. Verma dedicated eight years of his life to complete the book Concept of Physics, which proved to be a huge success and eventually made him a luminary among Indian students.

Endowed with broad interests, Dr. Prakash and his students have developed a computer that operates using water droplets. Their goal is to design a new class of computers that can precisely control and manipulate physical matter. Because of its universal nature, the droplet computer can theoretically perform any operation that a conventional electronic computer can crunch although at significantly slower rates.



Dr. Prakash had earlier shocked the scientific community by developing a pocket-size paper microscope which he has named as ""Foldscope"" - a printable, use-and-throw microscope made almost entirely from a sheet of paper and is powerful enough to detect a malaria parasite in a drop of blood, yet costs just 50 cents. By using parts from a music box, Dr. Prakash has created a device that can be programmed to mix precise amounts of chemical fluids in a way that is useful for both students and researchers. The design relies on metal pins that pass through punch card paper in order to release chemicals from individual channels. His prototype can be recreated for just $5.



Dr. Prakash is best known for his pioneering work in inventing high-tech tools using inexpensive materials - an endeavor he calls 'frugal science'. His inventions may have been designed to address complicated problems, but their low cost and simple designs make them accessible to everyone."

In 2011, TAL executed its first export order for Power Transformers for ZESCO, Zambia.

TAL is one of the few Indian transformer manufactures who have successfully grown into an established, recognized Power Transformer manufacturer owing to heavy investments in design, engineering and knowledge building. It has so far supplied more than 600,000 (approx. 50,000 MVA) transformers which are in active service in India. It is also one of the first transformer manufacturers in the country to have set up integrated facilities for processing of CRGO core, slitting, cutting and annealing, conductor manufacturing (drawing, annealing and paper covering), transformer Oil processing, tank fabrication, core assembly, winding, assembling and tanking. This has allowed it to have a stronger control on what goes inside the transformer and reduce dependence on external suppliers, thereby ensuring delivery timelines.

As the company prepares for its next stage of growth, it is focussed on leveraging its past-experience, knowledge and credentials to benchmark itself against global leaders, and to build continuous value for its customers, employees, vendors and shareholders. The entire success of the company rests on the shoulders of Mr. Agarwal and his capable team. He continues to direct the company towards manufacturing products and services that will deliver superior performance and hence contribute to the growth and welfare of society. He is also serving as the President of Executive Council at Indian Electrical & Electronics Manufacturers' Association (IEEMA)."
Mr. Pradeep Sindhu,"Mr. Pradeep Sindhu is the man behind Juniper Networks, one of the most established names in offering fundamentally unique solutions to the challenges of the global network. After setting up the company in 1996, Mr. Sindhu chose to play the role of a CTO over a CEO and designed the company's technology roadmap that steered Juniper Networks to phenomenal success.
Pradeep Sindhu stands out not only for his technical brilliance but also for his entrepreneurial vision. In June 2010, he received the Morgan Stanley Leadership Award for Global Commerce at IDG''s Computerworld Honors Program held in Washington, D.C.
""The theoretical background and breadth of knowledge that I gained have let me do things I otherwise would not have been able to do.""Hailing from an army background, Pradeep Sindhu was expected to join Indian Administrative Services (IAS). But, he had a different dream. Much against the wishes of his father, he joined IIT Kanpur in 1970 to study electrical engineering. As was the norm those days, he applied abroad for higher studies and got accepted at the University of Hawaii. There began his affair with networking and computing. In 1976, his quest for in-depth knowledge about the field took him to Carnegie Mellon University where he pursued his masters and doctorate in computer science with a focus on high-performance multiprocessors.

In 1984, Mr. Sindhu joined Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) as a research scientist. During his 11 years of association with the research center, he played several key roles in designing and developing tools for VLSI and high-speed interconnects for shared-memory multiprocessors which led to the commercial development of Sun Microsystems' first high-performance multiprocessor system family including the SS1000 and SS2000.

However, in 1995, he realized that it was time for him to leave the company and start his own venture. He was more of an inventor who wanted to take his ideas to the market. After months of brainstorming, he finally decided to start a company to supply high-performance routers to support the quickly emerging Internet. From September to November 1995, he worked on a design. Then began the hunt for VCs as the idea needed huge investment. After being turned down by three VCs, he finally won over Vinod Khosla at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers who decided to take a chance on the company.

On 25th June 1999, Juniper Networks went public. From there on, Juniper Networks has continued to develop innovative products and technologies thus remaining at the forefront of high-performance networking. With 88 offices in 43 countries and a revenue of $4.8 billion, the company has been ranked within the top 100 of the 500 largest publicly-traded companies in the US on the 2016 Newsweek Green Rankings.

Today, Mr. Pradeep Sindhu is arguably considered the technology world's most eminent CTO. In spite of having a net worth of $800 million, he continues to relentlessly pursue his passion for technology and innovation."

Mrs. Pooja Sankar,"Mrs. Pooja Sankar is the founder and CEO of Piazza Technologies Inc., a Palo Alto, California based social learning and recruiting platform for students. The company was borne out of the necessity to encourage peer learning in the education system. It is an online question-and-answer platform that connects students, TAs and professors thus providing intellectual space, freedom, or support to students to reach their maximum potential. Founded in 2009 and launched officially in January 2011 in the Stanford University campus, the platform is used today by approximately 30,000 educators and 1 million computer science, engineer, and math students across 1500 universities in 90 countries.Mrs. Pooja Sankar received her B.Tech. in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur in 2002. She later went to the USA for higher studies and obtained her master's degree in the same subject from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2004. Following it, she began working at Oracle as a software developer. In October 2006, she joined Kosmix and served there till January 2008. For the next seven months, she worked with the news feed team of Facebook. She gained extensive knowledge and expertise while working as a developer and eventually caught up to where her male classmates were in their careers. ""I wish I could do this while I had the opportunity in school,"" says she.

Throughout her college days, she felt a sense of loneliness. Being one of only three girl students in her engineering class, she felt extremely shy to discuss computer problems with her male classmates. ""I would sit in a corner of the computer lab and work on the problems all alone. They would all talk to one another, ask each other questions, and learn a lot by working together. I missed out on this learning. What was worse was I wouldn't even get to the core of the learning that the professors intended for us since I was stuck on a nuance and couldn't complete the assignment."" It was while pursuing her MBA at Stanford University, she decided to create a solution to encourage peer learning in the collegiate system. As she started talking to her classmates, she gathered confidence that perhaps there are many such students who would be needing some help. In 2009, she created the first prototype of the Piazza platform.

Piazza is an online learning tool that connects students, TAs and professors thus enabling students to maximize their learning potential. It can be effectively used with existing learning management systems. By February 2010, Piazza was accessible to only Standford students and was used by approximately 600 of them. In January 2011, she opened it publically for all institutions following which Piazza reached over 330 schools and tens of thousands of students by the summer of the same year. Currently, Piazza is used by over 75% of Stanford, MIT, Cornell, Princeton, Berkeley, Georgia Tech, Harvard undergrads for their classes online for over two hours a night.



Pooja Sankar didn't stop there with Piazza's success as a learning platform. She started thinking of ways of using this platform as an effective employment portal as well which would benefit both the employer and the employee. To transform her dream into a reality, the company began targeting company recruiters in February 2014 enabling them to run targeted searches and send highly personalized messages to students based on their choice. The platform was upgraded and customized to act as an attractive tool for recruiters who are in search of competent and skillful candidates for their company. It also provides an add-on feature to recruiters to search specifically for female students, if they wish to. Additionally, Piazza conducts surveys among student users about where they would want to work. Nearly 250 companies, ranging from startups to established names, have already signed up for the service.

The platform is already linked to 100 sought-after employers like Airbnb, Yahoo!, VMware, Google, Cisco, Morgan Stanley, GoDaddy, Intuit, Juniper, Capital One, Pinterest, and Microsoft. In future, Piazza endeavors to bring more women into STEM fields while also tackling diversity issues in companies."

Mr. Sudhir Vyas,"Mr. Sudhir Vyas is presently ambassador of India in Germany and is a presidential gold medalist of IIT Kanpur from the Class-of-75. He was amongst the first few IITians to change course and opt for an altogether different professional stream. This was a rare challenge in those early days, when the complex system of difficult entrance examinations and oral tests to enter the Indian civil services were so different, both in style and substance, from an IIT engineering syllabus. Yet he sat for the

all India civil services examinations conducted by the union public service commission to top the IAS in 1977. He joined the Indian foreign service the same year.Mr. Vyas had wide-ranging interests as a student at IIT Kanpur, from history to art, but he was especially known for his interest in and knowledge of wildlife, in particular, ornithology. A keen bird watcher, he had invited Padma Bhushan Shri Salim Ali, perhaps India most outstanding researcher, author and conservationist in this field to speak at IIT Kanpur. In the course of his diplomatic career spanning 32 years now, Sudhir has spent almost a third dealing with India neighbours where India foreign policy faces some of its severest challenges, either from those capitals or handling their affairs from the foreign ministry in Delhi. He has served in Kathmandu, Nepal, in those tumultuous days leading to the introduction of democracy in that country; in Pakistan, at a particularly difficult period in our bilateral relations that witnessed some of the most tricky diplomatic situations in that country, such as General Musharraf military coup, the IC 814 airplane hijacking and its violent aftermath, the Agra Summit and the risky situation during operation Parakram following the terrorist attack on our Parliament in 2001.



Mr. Vyas was Ambassador in Thimphu, Bhutan, with which India enjoys a specially close relationship, during a particularly historic period in that country that witnessed its transition to constitutional democracy and the coronation of its present King. Another area of Sudhir specialisation has been the Arab world, where he served as India ambassador to the UAE and earlier in Egypt and Algeria. He studied Arabic to meet the requirements of this specialisation. He has also considerable experience of multilateral diplomacy at the UN in New York, when he served as a member of India delegation to the UN security council when India was a member of that body in 1991-92, just when the former soviet union collapsed and the balance of power in the world began to change with the first Gulf war.

Mr. Vyas is now Indian ambassador to Germany, Europe economic powerhouse and a leading innovator of technologies for the future; today, in areas such as climate change and green energy issues, this diplomatic engagement and dialogue takes on a special relevance. And all through his diplomatic career that has taken him to so many different parts of the world, Sudhir has kept up his keen interest in birds, ornithology and wildlife in particular, and conservation issues in general. He is conferred with the distinguished alumnus award of the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur for his outstanding achievements in managing the diplomatic relations of India with several countries."
Mr. Rahul Sharma,"Rahul Sharma received his B.Tech. degree from IIT Kanpur in electrical engineering in 1987. He is 1992 batch IPS officer from the Gujarat cadre. He is also a law graduate. During the 2002 riots in Gujarat, he was Superintendent of Police (SP) of Vadodara. He is credited with saving many lives by ensuring order and harmony.Rahul was posted at Bhavnagar from Vadodara, where he was the western railways SP, just before February 27, 2002 - the day the Sabarmati Express was torched. At his new posting, Rahul ensured that peace was maintained in the district during his brief stint there. For the cause of peace and order, he felt compelled to ruffle the feathers of some of his superiors during this short tenure. In his line of duty, he had to resort to open fire on a mob which was on its way to attack members of another community in Bhavnagar town. Subsequently, he suffered humiliation by being posted a low-profile post.



During the process of enquiry, the tech savvy Rahul procured the cell phone call details of that period from cellforce and AT& T, the telecom service providers in the city at that time. These call details provided many important clues that led to the implication of many bigwigs of the state polity as well as the bureaucracy. Later, Rahul was sent on a deputation to the CBI in 2004 as the Gandhinagar SP. He was subsequently promoted and joined the CBI in Mumbai as DIG (economic offences wing) in May 2007. He returned after the five-year stint to his parent cadre and was posted at Rajkot as DIG arms unit in 2009.During these long years, Rahul performed his duties according to the provisions of law to serve the society, used the technology innovatively, and underwent a sequel of humiliation and harassment but upheld his value systems with exemplary sacrifices."

As Patna Municipal Commissioner (PMC) (April 2013- Jan 2015), he made all internal and external correspondences available on its website for public viewing and scrutiny, through a simple system of edak, thus bringing huge transparency. Tax data and transactions were made online using simple tools of IT and networking. These initiatives reduced opportunities for discretion and corruption. Such efforts of probity and transparency brought laurels to him but also got him criticism and hindrances from vested interests. In a Public Interests Litigation (PIL) monitored by Patna High Court on illegal construction violating master plan and building bye-laws, Mr. Narayan went against the tide with determination to enforce laws in letter and spirit. He brought sense and discipline in the concerned sectors by strict enforcement of building bye-laws. During this time, there was a ban on his transfer from Patna Municipal Corporation by order of Patna High Court as also affirmed by the Supreme Court. While it brought appreciation to him from the general public, it fetched enormous opposition, obstruction and threats from vested interests. In order to deal with Mafiosi nexus, he had to face adverse situation but he surpassed the same with fortitude and courage. Due to his honesty and integrity during the conduct of Legislative assembly elections 2015, he was posted as the District Magistrate of Madhubani at the direction of the Election Commission."

Mr. Rajiv Chawla,"Mr. Rajiv Chawla, an IAS officer of 1987 batch, is the Principal Secretary, Department of Horticulture and Sericulture, Government of Karnataka. For the last 30 years, he has been serving the state government without a single stint at the center. Essentially calling himself a technology person, he has combined his administrative skills and technology prowess to bring about e-governance revolution in the country. He initiated the digitization of land record systems in Karnataka and laid the foundations of the project ""Bhoomi"". He received the Prime Minister's award for excellence in civil services in 2007 for the project. In 2007, IIT Kanpur conferred upon him the Distinguished Alumnus Award for his significant contributions.Mr. Chawla received his B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur in 1984.

Mr. Chawla likes to call himself an 'IAS engineer' rather than an 'IAS officer', ""I am essentially a technology person, the IAS is incidental."" He is most known for laying foundations of the project BHOOMI, digitized land record systems in Karnataka, that he initiated at the time when digital revolution was still a nascent concept in India. He wanted to harness the power of technology to weed out corruption in land holdings in the state. Then the revenue secretary, Mr. Chawla employed a young workforce to collect data and help compile the state's first digitized land records. By 2003, Bhoomi had computerized records of 177 talukas of the state. ""We realized that the weak can only be helped by the strong and took a leaf out of ITC's e-choupal book."" In 2007, he was honored with the Prime Minister's Award for excellence in civil services for his pathbreaking project. He feels proud that every farmer in the state today is aware of what Bhoomi is.



He didn't stop there. To expand the reach of the project, he created Urban Property Ownership Records (UPOR) for which he even turned down a position in the Centre's e-governance initiative. In late 2009, UPOR was tried out in four towns, including Mysore, and the results were encouraging. He wanted to dig into urban property records in Bangalore, a large share of which is estimated to be illegal. However, he was transferred to the Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority as the Metropolitan Commissioner. Later, he had short stints with other departments before assuming his current role as a principal secretary with the state Department of Horticulture and Sericulture."

Through meticulous planning, well-thought-out strategy and a few handpicked officers, he carried out the discreet operations. ""I wanted a plan that would be perfect to the last detail. This would be the best way to ensure that bravery, honesty and good intentions were not crushed tragically,"" said Mr. Kumar.

More recently as SP ATS, Mr. Kumar has been active in tackling more heinous crimes and criminals like arresting ISIS operatives to busting pan-India counterfeit arms license scam operating from Jammu and Kashmir to detection of army recruitment scam and arresting more than a dozen dreaded interstate criminals.

Mr. Prem Das Rai,"Prem Das Rai, one of the most distinguished alumni of IIT Kanpur, is an Indian politician from the Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) party. He has been associated with the party since its formative years and has helped shaping the party's manifesto and the vision. He has held all the key posts in the party including being the party's General Secretary.

Mr. Rai continues to work towards the betterment of the Sikkimese people. ""The more you talk of technology, the more you talk of better processes. I firmly believe that there should be many more people in public life from such institutions.""Though Mr. Rai never thought of Politics as a career option not even on a distant horizon, he ended up being a politician who contributed immensely to the state of Sikkim. It was while working in the Bank of America at Kolkata that he met B.B. Lal, the then Governor of Sikkim, who mentored him and convinced him to work for the State. In 1979, he was appointed as a Project Manager in the Sikkim Flour Mills that was in the process of being set up. Later, he worked for the Sikkim government for 6 years in different capacities including the Managing Director of Sikkim Milk Union; Chairman of Sikkim Industrial Development and Investment Corporation (SIDICO) and Sikkim Scheduled Tribes and All Other Backward Classes Financial Development Corporation (SABCO); founding Chairman of the Ecotourism and Conservation Society of Sikkim (ECOSS); and CEO (Northeast) of BASIX.

Dr. K. M. Abraham,"Dr. Kandathil Mathew Abraham, a 1982 Kerala cadre IAS officer, is best known for exposing irregularities in the functioning of the Sahara group during his tenure as the whole-time member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Despite facing intense pressure from the government, he exposed two of the fraudulent companies of the group and held them liable to refund investors. IIT Kanpur has conferred upon him the Satyendra K Dubey Memorial Award 2016 for displaying highest professional integrity and honesty while serving his duty.Dr. Abraham is an M.Tech. in Industrial Management from IIT Kanpur.

During his tenure with the SEBI, he exposed the financial irregularities at the Sahara group and passed an order dated 23rd June 2011 against the Sahara India Real Estate Corporation (SIREC) and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation (SHIC). ""The two companies are without a doubt, clearly in gross violation of the provisions of the laws applicable to public companies making offers of securities to the public. (They) seem to be unable to furnish even basic data on the identity of its own investor..."" he said, in his order. He exposed the two shadowy companies so thoroughly that neither the Securities Appellate Tribunal nor the Supreme Court could find faults with it. The Supreme Court agreed with almost all the contentions of Dr. Abraham in his final order against the two Sahara companies. His work was so meticulous and unimpeachable that nobody could challenge its authenticity.



Interestingly, Dr. Abraham was not given an extension at SEBI allegedly due to immense political pressure. He even wrote a letter to the then Prime Minster accusing the Finance Ministry for pressuring the regulator to go easy on several high-profile cases including Sahara. Later, the Finance Ministry denied the allegations. His tenure ended under a cloud.

Late Mr. Satyendra Kumar Dubey,"Every alumnus of IIT Kanpur holds a special place in our heart but there are a very few whose names will go down in the history pages for their exemplary life and extraordinarily commendable work. Satyendra K. Dubey was one of those rare breeds of people who lost his life while fighting against the rampant corruption in our society.As a celebration of his life and in commemoration of his beliefs, IIT Kanpur has established an annual Satyendra K Dubey Memorial Award given to an IIT alumnus for displaying highest professional integrity in upholding human values. ""Don't remember me or my work, just one request, remember my message.""Mr. Satyendra Dubey hailed from a very humble background. Born in 1973 in the Shahpur village, Bihar, he strived hard to receive education amidst the daily struggles of life. He not only topped the 10th and 12th state board exams but also cleared his way through one of the most competitive engineering exams in the country. In 1994, he graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at IIT Kanpur. Two years later, he completed his M.Tech. from IIT BHU, Varanasi.

When the time came to choose a career, Satyendra opted for the Indian Engineering Services instead of a high-paying corporate job. As his brother recalls, ""My brother was one of the most idealistic people I have met in my life. He believed in his country and wanted to contribute towards the building of a strong nation."" In July 2002, Satyendra joined the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on deputation. While serving as the Project Director at Koderma, Jharkhand, he exposed severe financial and contractual irregularities involved in the construction of a stretch of NH2. Such was his determination and sincerity that he had the contractor rebuilt 6 km of poor quality road, a huge loss for the road contract mafia. As it has happened time and again, he was transferred to Gaya much against his wishes. However, he continued to embrace his life's principles and exposed large-scale flouting of NHAI rules regarding sub-contracting and quality control at Gaya.

On 27th November 2003, while returning from a wedding in Varanasi, Satyendra was shot dead in front of the circuit house in Gaya. It is speculated that he was murdered as his ideals stood in the way of many. The tragic news of his death drew sharp reactions from various quarters of society. Students and alumni bodies of IITs came forward in demanding justice for him. Two of his batch mates at the institute, Ashutosh Aman and Atal Bansal set up the S. K. Dubey Foundation for Fight Against Corruption in India to systematically fight against the evil. On behalf of the foundation, Ashutosh Aman produced a small documentary on Satyendra Dubey directed by Mini Vaid which was aired on NDTV on 26 November 2007.

Satyendra K Dubey's life is time and again covered in popular media. The famous Indian musician Rabbi Shergill dedicated few lines to him in one of his songs 'Jinhe naaz hai hind pe vo kahaan hain'. Several awards and fellowships have been set up in his name to keep his legacy alive. The Indian Express fellowship, Satyendra K Dubey Memorial Award by IIT Kanpur, Satyendra Dubey Award for civil services by IRDS, Lucknow, are to name a few.

In 2007, he returned to Seattle and became a part of Bezos's much-coveted team of technical advisers prominently known as the Shadow Team.

Under Mr. Agarwal's leadership, Amazon has grown in leaps and bounds over the past few years and is focused on bringing global innovations to India.

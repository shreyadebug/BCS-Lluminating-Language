# ChatIITK - An Advanced RAG ChatBot for IITK Junta

Developed by BCS under its Summer Project - Lluminating Language

## Environment Setup

The app is still in prototyping stage so before running, create a separate virtual environment, so that there are no conflicts.
```
conda create -n ChatIITK python=3.10.0
conda activate ChatIITK
```

After successfully creating a virtual env, install all the requirement for the project

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference

- To start the Terminal interface run `python run_ChatIITK.py`
- To start the Streamlit UI run `streamlit run ChatIITK_UI.py`
